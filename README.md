# PHP_AE1_PRACTICAL
PHP Practical assignment undertaken at Solent University in my Second Year
------------------------------------

This assignment tasked me with creating a Night Out! Website in order for users to search for a venue type and receive a list
of venues around the city. Users are also able to add venues, recommend venues, and review venues. Admins must approve venues
before they're publicy displayed on the website.

This project also explored the use of AJAX to allow users to search for and review a venue while staying on the same web page.
